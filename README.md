# covid_19_ireland

Shiny App on new cases and deaths. Focused on Europe and North America, particularly Ireland.

You can see it [here](https://robertmylesmcdonnell.shinyapps.io/covid/), it looks like this:

I made this because the Irish Government's Covid App shows a graph of cases only. I don't think that's helpful.

I made it with R, using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/).

Data come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), specifically [here](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
