Shiny App on new cases and deaths. Focused on Europe and North America, particularly Ireland.

I made this because the Irish Government's Covid App shows a graph of cases only. I don't think that's helpful.

Data come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), specifically [here](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
